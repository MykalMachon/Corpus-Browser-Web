## Notes Folder
This folder is being used to take notes regarding the transfer of code from the source project "Corpora Browser" to Corpora Browser Web. 
We will be reviewing each function in Corpora Browser, documenting it's use/effect, and determining whether or not it should be transfered to the corpora browser web platform. 

This is neccesary as the existing Corpora Browser application is heavily integrated with SQLLite and TKinter which are not going to be usable in a web based implementation. 
That said, the core "business" logic of the app is still solid and could be ported to the web version to save development time. 

Contact mykal.machon@student.ufv.ca with any questions.
